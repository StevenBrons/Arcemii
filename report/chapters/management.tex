\subsection*{Introduction}
This section contains a log for the process of builing our teams second app for the \textit{Research and Development} Course at Radboud University.
Our process wil be presented in a weekly description of the active tasks that week, project meetings, assignment of tasks, problems we encountered, etc.

\subsection*{Week 19}
After the spring break, in which we did not yet start our new project as most would've been unable to work on it, we decided that a meeting on Monday morning would be wise. This meeting took place in Mercator I, lasted from 10:30 till 12:15, and was attended by Jelmer, Robert, Steven, Thijs and halfway through also by Thomas.
The main topic of this meeting was choosing which app idea we would run with. We had three prominent ones:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A multiplayer dungeon crawler. This idea had us very excited at first, but we realized that this would mean a very similar project structure to the Sokoban app of the previous assignment, so we dismissed the idea.
	\item An medical application in cooperation with medicine students, as suggested by Patrick van Bommel. This idea seemed cool, but did not motivate us as much, as we would have to deal with outside requirements instead of our own ideas about what would make a good addition to the app.
	\item A mario-party-like game with multiplayer minigames. By now we had settled on the idea of building a game, as we had a lot of fun doing th eprevious assignment. By making a game centred around minigames, we think we'll be able to make this process fun fr ourselves. We'll have to put some effort in making a connection between two phones.
\end{itemize}

The third is the idea we had settled on about halfway through the meeting. We made some sketched of the project layout and brainstormed on some minigames (like spyfall and charades)

We planned our next meeting for Thursday, third block. By then, Steven will have set-up a new Github repository.
\bigbreak\noindent
Thursday we had our next meeting, which was attended by everyone. In the previous days, we had all thought about the idea of something using a server, and had become sceptical about how good of an idea it was. We discussed the following risks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Our app will probably be tested by one person, but they will have to be able to use the app's full functionality to properly grade it. Robert has sent an e-mail to our TA with questions about this, so we'll await their response and then look at this risk again.
		\item It is tisky that our whole app relies on one connection. If something goes wrong in the connection part, the whole app will suffer from it.
		\item Four weeks for an app is already a short timeframe. Will we be able to afford the time to spend on multiplayer functionality? This is something we'll have to decide upon once we have more concrete ideas about games we'd like to make.
\end{itemize}
Because of the above mentioned risks, we further discussed the possibilities of single-player games, as the idea of the app being a game remained unchanged. Thomas and Thijs were charged with the task to think about games in the rogue-like genre, in order to see if such a game would be a valuable app idea. Steven will make the structure of a client-server program. This way, we can have some extra days to decide on our idea, as we'd like the whole group to be fully behind it, hard as it is, while also getting started on some code.
